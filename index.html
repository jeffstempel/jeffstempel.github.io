        <h1>Operated Restaurant For Sale - Turn Key Operation</h1>
        <div>
            This profitable family-style restaurant has been
            owner operated for over 27 years. The long-
            term customer base has led to consistent wait lines on
            certain days of the week.<br/>
            The owner has successfully enjoyed steady growth
            in sales which can provide a new owner a turn-key
            business with immediate cash flow. Commitment,
            loyalty and hard work has made this a strong business
            that offers great food with a wide-variety of desirable
            dishes on the menu.<br/>
            While maintaining this business has provided con-
            sistent cash flow, the restaurant has not maximized its
            potential growth. An ambitious entrepreneur with
            new innovative ideas can expand on the great founda-
            tion that has been established and experience poten-
            tially increased revenue. Additional hours, catering or
            even an outdoor sidewalk caf&eacute; are great options.

            <h3>Financials</h3>
            The owner has built a profitable business that has
            provided steady cash flow for years. The gross profit

            has exceeded the industry standards.

            <h3>Reason for Selling</h3>

            The owner is preparing for retirement and would like

            to see a motivated buyer carry on and benefit from

            his history of success.

            <h3>Style</h3>

            This home-style family restaurant has seating for 125.

            The staff consists of 4 full time and 6 part time all of

            which includes cooks, waiters and hosts. The menu

            is filled with dishes that please all appetites.

            <h3>Competition</h3>

            Franchise restaurants are located throughout the area

            but nothing similar to the family-style

            vast variety in the menu options.

            <h3>Location</h3>

            Set on endcap space of strip mall in a large northern

            suburb of the Twin Cities, this location is in a prime

            area. Surrounded by multiple retail shops, office

            buildings, banks, churches and a large anchor grocery.

            With visibility from a high traffic area there is great

            opportunity for new, attractive signage.

            <h3>Growth and Expansion</h3>

            With the continued growth over the previous years,

            the buyer can consider expanding to the next level.

            An extension of hours or adding an inviting outdoor

            patio that could provide a great setting for morning

            breakfasts to summer evening dinners would be a

            couple of considerations.

            <h3>CONFIDENTIALITY (see attached)</h3>
            Customers, competitors and employees

            become hesitant when a business is for

            sale, often triggering reactions that can

            weaken the momentum and therefore its

            value. The Seller's goal is to carefully

            protect its trade secrets and financial in-
            formation for the <b><u>benefit of the next

            owner.</u></b> Before releasing further details,

            the party offering this business for sale

            requires a signed confidentiality agree-
            ment.
