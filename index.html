        <div id="intro">
            <p>This profitable family-style restaurant has been
            owner operated for over 27 years. The long-term customer base has led to consistent wait lines on
            certain days of the week.</p>
            <p>The owner has successfully enjoyed steady growth
            in sales which can provide a new owner a turn-key
            business with immediate cash flow. Commitment,
            loyalty and hard work has made this a strong business
            that offers great food with a wide-variety of desirable
            dishes on the menu.</p>
            <p>While maintaining this business has provided consistent cash flow, the restaurant has not maximized its
            potential growth. An ambitious entrepreneur with
            new innovative ideas can expand on the great foundation that has been established and experience potentially increased revenue. Additional hours, catering or
            even an outdoor sidewalk caf&eacute; are great options.</p>

            <h3>Financials</h3>
            <p>The owner has built a profitable business that has provided steady cash flow for years. 
                The gross profit has exceeded the industry standards.</p>
            <h3>Reason for Selling</h3>
            <p>The owner is preparing for retirement and would like to see a motivated buyer carry on and benefit from
                his history of success.</p>
            <h3>Style</h3>
            <p>This home-style family restaurant has seating for 125.
            The staff consists of 4 full time and 6 part time all of
            which includes cooks, waiters and hosts. The menu
            is filled with dishes that please all appetites.</p>
            <h3>Competition</h3>
            <p>Franchise restaurants are located throughout the area
            but nothing similar to the family-style
            vast variety in the menu options.</p>
            <h3>Location</h3>
            <p>Set on endcap space of strip mall in a large northern
            suburb of the Twin Cities, this location is in a prime
            area. Surrounded by multiple retail shops, office
            buildings, banks, churches and a large anchor grocery.
            With visibility from a high traffic area there is great
            opportunity for new, attractive signage.</p>
            <h3>Growth and Expansion</h3>
            <p>With the continued growth over the previous years,
            the buyer can consider expanding to the next level.
            An extension of hours or adding an inviting outdoor
            patio that could provide a great setting for morning
            breakfasts to summer evening dinners would be a
            couple of considerations.</p>

            <h2>CONFIDENTIALITY (see attached)</h2>
            <p>Customers, competitors and employees
            become hesitant when a business is for
            sale, often triggering reactions that can
            weaken the momentum and therefore its
            value. The Seller's goal is to carefully
            protect its trade secrets and financial information for the <b><u>benefit of the next
            owner.</u></b> Before releasing further details,
            the party offering this business for sale
            requires a signed confidentiality agreement.</p>
